# Training

OK folks. Here's our first github repo. It has only three files in it. A markdown file called `README.md`, an image called `screenshot1.png` and another called `cloning.png`. You should be able to see these files listed by file name in a box which shows our `source tree`. You can click on any of them to take a look. 

The text you're reading now is the contents of the `README.md` file. By default, github takes the contents of a file with that name and displays them here to explain / introduce the repo.

Go ahead and open up this file by clicking on `README.md`.

In the page that comes up next you'll see a preview of the file. Click on the pencil icon to edit this file.

This should take you to screen that looks like this ![A nice screenshot of github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erbium/training/master/screenshot1.png).

You can see at the top there are two tabs: Edit file and Preview changes. Go ahead and click between these. The edit file tab shows the *raw* content of the file and the preview button shows how this looks when it gets turned into HTML. It will also highlight things you added in green and things you deleted in red.

What was that I said about HTML? It might seem weird, but that's what the `.md` at the end of the file is doing. It's telling github this is a `markdown` file and github knows how to turn those into HTML and display them in a pretty way.

So we've covered this:

 - The front page of a github repo shows the files in your repo and then it shows your `README` if you have one.
 - You can click on any file in the source tree and github will show you its contents and let you edit it.
 - Github will let you **preview** your changes before you save them.

So now let's learn about the last thing: saving your changes.

In github we don't save changes, we `commit` them. A commit is like a save except it can include lots of files at once. You'll learn more about why this useful in the future. For now, just edit this file (by adding something beneath this text) and then commit your changes (I've intentionally left "how to commit" ambiguous. Go ahead and play around on this page and figure it out).
